# Patents & Open Standards

This specification is published as an **open standard**. Our goal is broad adoption, not exclusive control.

## Our Commitment

XAL is published under **CC-BY-4.0** to maximize adoption across:
- Government agencies (VA, EAC, FDA, DoD)
- Healthcare systems
- Financial services
- Election infrastructure

## Patent Approach

Aevion LLC has filed patents covering **implementation techniques**, not the data format itself:

| What We Patent | What We Don't |
|----------------|---------------|
| Compiler optimizations | JSON/YAML bundle format |
| Consensus algorithms | Effect type naming |
| Hardware integration | Verification methods |

## Why This Matters

We believe:
- **Standards beat proprietary lock-in** - XAL adoption creates ecosystem value
- **First-mover advantage** comes from deployment, not litigation
- **Regulated industries** need open standards they can trust
